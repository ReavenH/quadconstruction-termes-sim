# quadconstruction-termes-sim
The simulator for collective robotic construction with quadruped robots using 2x1 rectangular blocks. Adapted from the TERMES system.

Usage: 
    - run `zh_MultiTermSimOpenGL.py` for multi-agent construction simulation;
    - change `mode` variable to choose which kind of structure to build, plan graph is predefined;
    - change `numAgents` to choose the number of agents;
