# termes-sim

To run a basic version of the simulator run "MultiTermSim". It builds a "castel" using 10 robots. 

A more basic version of the agent, one that interacts with the environment but does not change the structure you can run "TermSim". And then use the keys 'f,r,l' to drive the robot around.
